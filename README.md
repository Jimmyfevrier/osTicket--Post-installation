<p>
  <h3> Create Agents and Clients: </h3>
  I created a Client and Agent Tab so I could setup a communnication path between them:

- Note the Client create the ticket as the Agent can choose to work on the ticket or forward the ticket to the correct department for assistance.

</p>
<p>
  <h3> Provided Agents and Clients with Permissions and Roles: </h3>
From the Admin Control Panel, I Added my Agents and create departments and Roles for each of them. As well as, allowing certain Agents to have certain permission assuming the needs of the departments they were placed in.

</p>
<p>
  <h3> Explore differences in Acess: </h3>
I granted certain department Access to view certain tickets. In doing so allowed me to assign my made up Agents to the desired department, granting individuals Access to tickets that fit that particular departments.

</p>
<p>
  <h3> Create SLAs and Exploring how to solve a ticket: </h3>
I went ahead and created SLAs settings for the tickets resolve time. As I know SLA are curcial in ensuring that all clients are getting their issues prioritized and all agreement are being meant within the SLA guidelines.

</p>
<br />
<p>
  In wanting to make sure that I could get a basic practice in the workfeild I created mock tickets. I assigned them in importance and within departments to test out which Agents would have access to certian tickets and which agent wouldn't be able to see certain tickets. Also went over reassigning tickets to ensure that will be address by the best team involved.
